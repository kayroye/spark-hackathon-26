Challenge 1: Care Coordination (ReferralLoop)
3.1. Problem Analysis: The Broken Chain
The case study identifies "care coordination" as the primary failure point. The current reliance on "phone calls, paper forms, and basic spreadsheets" creates a system with no memory and no accountability. The cardiac incident 1 was a direct result of a referral falling into a "black hole"—sent but never tracked. Wait times for specialist referrals in Canada average 30 weeks 1, making the tracking of these long-cycle transactions critical. The breakdown is not just administrative; it is clinical. Without a "closed-loop" system, there is no verification that the patient was seen, no feedback on the diagnosis, and no trigger for the necessary follow-up care in the community.
3.2. Solution: ReferralLoop Web Application
ReferralLoop is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to function as the central nervous system of Clearwater Ridge's healthcare interactions. It replaces the passive spreadsheet with an active, intelligent, state-aware referral engine.
3.2.1. Feature Set: Intelligent Digitization and Workflow
A. Local-First Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Scanner: The entry point for data is often a paper fax or a handwritten note. ReferralLoop integrates Tesseract.js, a pure JavaScript OCR engine, to allow nurses to photograph documents directly within the app.12 The image processing occurs locally on the tablet, extracting text without uploading the image to a cloud server. This is coupled with a local LLM (e.g., Phi-3 Mini running via WebLLM) to structure this raw text into a coherent JSON object compatible with the FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard.13
Workflow: The nurse snaps a photo of a discharge summary. The app locally extracts "Diagnosis: Atrial Fibrillation" and "Plan: Warfarin 5mg." The nurse verifies the data, and it is committed to the local database.
Benefit: Eliminates manual transcription errors and creates a searchable digital record instantly, offline.
B. The "Kanban" of Care:
The interface utilizes a drag-and-drop Kanban board metaphor (New, Pending, Scheduled, Completed, Missed) to visualize the status of every patient. This provides immediate visual cues regarding bottlenecks.
Stale State Alerts: Automated logic monitors the "age" of a referral. If a referral remains in "Pending" for more than 14 days, the card turns red and moves to the top of the list, triggering a notification to the nurse.15 This proactive alerting system prevents patients from being "lost" in the waitlist abyss.
C. Patient "Smart Wallet" via Dynamic QR Codes: To empower patients and ensure data portability during transfers (e.g., medical evacuations), the app generates a Dynamic QR Code for each patient. This code, when scanned by another provider (even one outside the ReferralLoop network), renders a read-only, time-limited view of the patient's critical health summary, active medications, and recent referrals.16
Offline Capability: The data payload is compressed and encoded directly into the QR code string (for small datasets) or served via a local Wi-Fi Direct handshake for larger files.17 This ensures that the patient's medical history travels with them, physically, regardless of internet availability.
D. Automated Multi-Channel Reminders: The system integrates with Twilio's programmable messaging API to send automated appointment reminders via SMS.18 Given the demographic mix of seniors and seasonal workers, SMS is chosen for its ubiquity and compatibility with basic feature phones.
Feature: "Bot-in-the-Loop." The SMS asks for confirmation ("Reply YES to confirm"). If the patient replies "NO" or does not reply, the system automatically flags the referral for human intervention, prompting a Community Health Representative (CHR) to visit the home. This reduces the "no-show" rate, which costs the system ~$200 per event.1
3.2.2. Technical Architecture and Data Sovereignty
The backend logic utilizes HAPI FHIR, an open-source implementation of the FHIR standard, ensuring that Clearwater Ridge's data is structured according to national interoperability standards.19 However, unlike typical cloud deployments, this FHIR server runs on a ruggedized local server node (e.g., an Intel NUC) within the nursing station.
Privacy Architecture: All patient data is encrypted at rest using AES-256. The encryption keys are managed locally by the Community Health Council, satisfying the "Control" aspect of OCAP. External access requires explicit, granular permission grants, logged on a tamper-evident audit trail.20
3.2.3. Pros and Cons Analysis

Dimension
Pros
Cons
Scalability
FHIR-native architecture allows for easy integration with future provincial EMRs (Epic, Cerner) via standard APIs.21 The system can easily expand to track other interaction types (e.g., social work).
Handling large volumes of OCR/LLM processing on older tablets may cause performance bottlenecks. Mitigation: Use WebWorkers to offload processing from the main thread.22
Accessibility
The SMS interface allows engagement from any device. The Kanban board is intuitive for non-technical staff.
The app requires a level of digital literacy for the nurses. Mitigation: Extensive onboarding and a simplified "Lite" mode for basic users.
Resilience
Offline-first design ensures zero downtime during storms. The QR wallet protects patients during emergency transport.
Synchronization conflicts (e.g., two nurses editing the same file) can still occur in complex edge cases, though CRDTs minimize this.
